# Project: Form Validations

## Description

Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.
Don't use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is correctly filled in or not. 
Highlight a field red and give a helpful error message until it has been corrected.
